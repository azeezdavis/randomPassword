# randomPassword
In this project, I programmed a random password generator by which you can create unique passwords depending on selected password key strings. As per implemented key string, named as lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols: the complexity and intricacy level of the generated password exponentially increases, and therefore you can create various password levels entering the same password length. For instance, you can create a password including 20 characters by implementing either lowercase and uppercase key strings or uppercase and symbols key strings.
